#Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
The client was the company DriverPass. They wanted to make an online system that allowed students to take online learning and driving lessons for their official drivering test. This was made to help new drivers pass their test on the first time. 
#What did you do particularly well?
I think that I was able to understand the needs of the client very well and articulate that into the Business Requirments document. 
#If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I think I could revise the Use Case diagram. I would add more details to it. 
#How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I read the requirments and made sure their needs were first in the system design. It is important to consider the user's needs because they are the ones paying us to develop a program for them. Getting their needs correct builds trust and might make them want to come back to us for future work
#How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
I approach designing software by understanding the requirments and building a piece of software from that.
